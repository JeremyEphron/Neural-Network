# Neural-Network
My go at a basic, feed forward neural network in python, completely generalized for the amount of neurons per layers and amount of layers.
I'm excited to build some fun things from it.

### Thanks
I want to give thanks to Milo Spencer-Harper's [Medium post](https://medium.com/technology-invention-and-more/how-to-build-a-simple-neural-network-in-9-lines-of-python-code-cc8f23647ca1) and Andrew Trask's [blog post](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/) about basic neural networks. Two fantastic articles to get started on the seemingly daunting topic.
